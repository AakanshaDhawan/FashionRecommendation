# Scientific Programming in Python â€“ submission 3

### Project title: H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations

### Student name: Aakansha Dhawan

## How to compile the code:
  Step 1) Go to the Kaggle page and downlad the data(articles.csv, customer.csv, transaction_train.csv)
  
  Step 2) Keep all the files in one folder
  
  Step 3) Run the python notebooks in following sequence:
  
            a)data analysi and extraction.ipynb : contains analysis regarding the data
            b)collabrative filtering.ipynb : contains user based filtering
            c)item based collaborative filter.ipynb : shows how item based filtering works
            d)content based filtering.ipynb : content based filter is implemented here
            e)comparison.ipynb: this notebook contains comparison of all the algorithms
            
            
  P.S. notebooks can be run in any sequence as the data extracted and used for algorithms is present in women_wear_2018_winter.csv 
            

## Description

H & M (Hennes & Mauritz) group launched a competition on Kaggle where given the previous transactions of the customers is given and a product recommendation system has to be built.

The main aim behind this problem is to help customer by predicting what are they more likely to buy within 7 days after the training data ends and more importantly, assisting consumers in making sound decisions benefits sustainability since it lowers returns and, as a result, lowers transportation-related emissions.

## Data Description

### Link to [data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data)

The data is nearly 35 gb in size which consists of:
  1) articles : metadata about the products that are available for purchase
  2) customer : metadata for each customer
  3) transactions_train : the training data, which includes extra data as well as the purchases made by each consumer on each day. Multiple purchases of the same item                              are represented by duplicate rows.
  
## Algorithms 

  1) Collaborative filtering
      a) User Based
      b) Item Based
  2) Content-based filtering
  
## Libraries used

 1) numpy
 2) pandas
 3) matplotlib
 4) seaborn
 5) scikitlearn
 6) tensorflow
 7) pytorch
  
## Work Done
 1) Data analysis
 2) User based Collaborative filtering 
 3) Function for Item based Collaborative filtering
 4) Finding top N items recommended for each user
 5) Apply Content based filtering
 6) Apply item based collaborative filtering
 7) Compare between the two
 8) Right now because only small data is being taken two week categories have been made need to think of a better solution to include more week data

## Learning outcome
 
 The aim of choosing this problem is learn more about recommendations system and how to help people ease there life with its (recommendation system) use.
 
 By completing this project I got to the internal working of Recommendation Engines. I learnt about different algorithms of recommendation like Collaborative filtering and Content based filterting.
 
 Also, learnt some what about Natural language processing concepts like Term Frequency - Inverse Document frequency, Word Vectors etc
